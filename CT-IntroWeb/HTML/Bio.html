<h1>codetahoe bio assignment</h1>
<h2>Who am I and where did I come from</h2>
<p> I grew up in Costa Mesa California, which is located 40 minutes south of Los Angles. Growing up my parents were supportive with action sports and my love for adrenaline. I began skateboarding when I was 2, and quickly began pursuing other sports. Today I am into almost any sport that requires a board or a high thrill experience. Although I grew up minutes form the beach, I did not learn to surf, nor do is it a heavy part of my life today. I chose to spend my highschool days at the beach, laying in the sun, with a <em>cold beer</em> in my hand.</p>
<h2>After the high school dream ended</h2>
<p>As quickly as it came, high school living was gone. My parents were on my back about a job and what I was going to do with my life, and when it came down to it, I had no idea. I did knwo that I wanted to pursue snowboarding, but I also knew that my parents wanted me to continue my education. With no motivation to get a 9-to-5 job, and the parental sponsorship ending, I realied I need to make a decision. It was not till I was threatened with the boot, that I applied to a college. Once at <a href="http://www.sierranevada.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Sierra Nevada College</strong></a>I discovered my love for education. Unlike high school I was gaining knowledge that I was actually interesed in. From here I burried my head in books and begain absorbing all the information I could.</p><img src="https://adkwriter15.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/buried-in-books.jpg" alt"peson burried by book"/>
